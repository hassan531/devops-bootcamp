# Day 1 - $(date)



## What I learned
[
    Basic Linux commands like touch, mv, grep
    Permission control like chmod +x, chmod 777
    Simple scripting
    Github version control(add, commit, add remote, -M branch, push)
]

## What Confused Me
[ I believe I might need a little bit more practice on permission control, git interactions and scripting]

## Tomorrow's goal
[
    practice scripting and git procedures
]
